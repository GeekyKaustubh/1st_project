# Data Analysis Using 'Pandas'
The provided file showcases data analysis using Python's Pandas library on two separate datasets. The first dataset, in CSV format, contains information about Netflix movies and series. The second dataset focuses on student records, including marks and other details.

The analysis aims to extract valuable insights from both datasets. For the Netflix data, this includes identifying top-rated content and determining optimal viewing durations. By analyzing audience preferences for genres and content length, this study can help Netflix make informed decisions about future content acquisition and production, ultimately driving viewership and ratings.

The second dataset demonstrates Pandas' versatility in data manipulation beyond Netflix. Here, the analysis explores merging datasets and saving the results as a CSV file. This exemplifies additional capabilities like data cleaning and filtering, which can be applied to various data sources.
